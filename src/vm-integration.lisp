;;;; vm-integration.lisp — wire the JS runtime into the cl-cc VM.
;;;;
;;;; Compiled JS runs on the VM, but the JS host runtime (Array.map callbacks,
;;;; method dispatch, `this' binding, prelude globals) must know how to invoke a
;;;; VM closure. That glue was historically installed by the pipeline, coupling
;;;; the pipeline to :cl-cc/javascript internals. It now lives here: JS owns it
;;;; and registers itself with cl-cc/bootstrap; the pipeline runs every
;;;; registered backend's installer/seeder without naming any backend.
;;;;
;;;; This is why :cl-cc/javascript depends on :cl-cc-vm.
